# The file ActionLabels_en_GB.properties is the shared "Action" resource bundle
# for the Great Britain locale using English. It overrides only those resources
# in the default bundle where the most common spellings differ in Great Britain
# from the USA. Note that Canada is different too, but closer to USA spellings.
#
# Note that action accelerators are currently universal vs. locale-specific.
